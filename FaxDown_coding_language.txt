have to choose syntax
compiled or interpreted? or both??
name: FaxDown
; or \n as a command end
file extension: fxdn
cmd command: interpreter: FaxD filename.fxdn, compiler: FaxDc filename.fxdn


data types: char, string, short, int, long, float, double, bool
variables
dynmaic arrays
maybe arrays with different types of data ?
for, while, if, else, else if
functions
structures
dictionaries
maybe classes

easy out of the box:
math functions
file management(maybe bitmap and video too)
window(gui)(maybe just maybe OpenGL support....)
web scraping(html download and search by class and so on)
tcp
multithreading
